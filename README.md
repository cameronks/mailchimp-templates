===================


MailChimp doesn't have a simple enough html template out of the box.

Here's the steps to create a simple HTML template.

1. In MailChimp, go to the Templates page, click the "Create Template" button.
2. Select the "Code Your Own" starting point, and "Paste in code".
3. The HTML editor will open. On the right side, select all the HTML and delete it.
4. Paste in the contents of simple.html.
5. Click "Save and Exit". Give the template a name when prompted.
